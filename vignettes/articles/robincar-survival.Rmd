`RobinCar2` implements survival analysis methods for testing treatment effects with log-rank tests and estimating hazard ratios using score functions. This vignette provides an overview of the underlying algorithms.

# Overview of Survival Analysis Methods

# Details of the Methods

## Standard analysis without strata or covariates

Following Section 2 in @YeShaoYi2023, the score function from the partial likelihood under the Cox proportional hazards model $\lambda_{1}(t) = \lambda_{0}(t) \exp(\theta)$ is given by:

$$
\begin{align*}
U_{L}(\theta) 
&= 
\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} \int_{0}^{\tau} 
\left\{
I_{i} - \frac{\exp(\theta) \overline{Y}_{1}(t)}{\overline{Y}_{0}(t) + \exp(\theta) \overline{Y}_{1}(t)}
\right\}
dN_i(t)\\
&=
\frac{1}{n} \sum_{j=1}^{m}
I_{j} - \frac{\exp(\theta) \overline{Y}_{1}(t_{j})}{\overline{Y}_{0}(t_{j}) + \exp(\theta) \overline{Y}_{1}(t_{j})}
\end{align*}
$$

where we switched from the summation over all patients $i = 1, \dotsc, n$ to the summation over all patients with events $j = 1, \dotsc, m$ where $m \leq n$. 
The treatment indicator is $I_{j} = 1$ if patient $j$ is in treatment group 1, and $I_{j} = 0$ if patient $j$ is in treatment group 0. The proportions of patients at risk at time $t_{j}$, per arm $k = 0, 1$ is given by

$$
\overline{Y}_{k}(t_{j}) = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} \mathbb{I}(I_{i} = k) \mathbb{I}(t_{i} \geq t_{j})
$$

where $t_{i}$ is the potentially right-censored time of patient $i$ and $\mathbb{I}(\cdot)$ is the indicator function.

The corresponding variance estimate is given by this adapted version using the correction factor $c_{\theta}(t)$ which accounts for ties in the survival times in the log-rank test. 

$$
\begin{align*}
\sigma_{L}^{2}(\theta)
&=
\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} \int_{0}^{\tau}
\frac{\exp(\theta) \overline{Y}_{0}(t) \overline{Y}_{1}(t) c_{\theta}(t)}{\overline{Y}_{\theta}(t)^{2}}
dN_i(t)
\\
&= 
\frac{1}{n} \sum_{j=1}^{m}
\frac{\exp(\theta) \overline{Y}_{0}(t_{j}) \overline{Y}_{1}(t_{j}) c_{\theta}(t_{j})}{\overline{Y}_{\theta}(t_{j})^{2}}
\end{align*}
$$

where we abbreviated 

$$
\overline{Y}_{\theta}(t) = \overline{Y}_{0}(t) + \exp(\theta) \overline{Y}_{1}(t)
$$

and similarly

$$
\overline{Y}_{\theta}(t_{j}) = \overline{Y}_{0}(t_{j}) + \exp(\theta) \overline{Y}_{1}(t_{j}).
$$

Let $\delta_{i}$ be the binary event indicator for patient $i$, and let the number of events at time $t_{j}$ be denoted by $m(t_{j}) = \sum_{i=1}^{n} \delta_{i} \mathbb{I}(t_{i} = t_{j})$. We define then the correction factor $c_{\theta}(t_{j})$ as follows:

$$
c_{\theta}(t_{j}) = 
\begin{cases}
1 & \text{if } m(t_{j}) = 1 \\
\frac{n \overline{Y}_{\theta}(t_{j}) - m(t_{j})}{n \overline{Y}_{\theta}(t_{j}) - 1} & \text{if } m(t_{j}) > 1
\end{cases}
$$

Furthermore, we note that this correction factor is only used when calculating the log-rank test statistic, which is given at $\theta = 0$ by

$$
\mathcal{T}_{L} = \sqrt{n} U_{L}(0) / \sigma_{L}(0).
$$

However, when we estimate the log hazard ratio $\theta$ by finding the root $\hat{\theta}_{L}$ of the score function such that $U_{L}(\hat{\theta}_{L}) = 0$, we set $c_{\theta}(t_{j}) \equiv 1$.

The standard error of $\hat{\theta}_{L}$ is given by

$$
\frac{1}{\sqrt{n} \sigma_{L}(\hat{\theta}_{L})}.
$$

This score function and the variance estimator are implemented in the internal function `RobinCar2:::h_lr_score_no_strata_no_cov()`.

## Stratified analysis without covariates

Following Section S2.3 in @YeShaoYi2023, the score function for the stratified log-rank test is given by:

$$
\begin{align*}
U_{SL}(\theta) 
&= 
\frac{1}{n} \sum_{z} \sum_{i: Z_{i} = z} \int_{0}^{\tau} 
\left\{
I_{i} - \frac{\exp(\theta) \overline{Y}_{z1}(t)}{\overline{Y}_{z0}(t) + \exp(\theta) \overline{Y}_{z1}(t)}
\right\}
dN_i(t)\\
&=
\frac{1}{n} \sum_{z} \sum_{j(z)}
I_{j} - \frac{\exp(\theta) \overline{Y}_{z1}(t_{j})}{\overline{Y}_{z0}(t_{j}) + \exp(\theta) \overline{Y}_{z1}(t_{j})}
\end{align*}
$$

where the last sum is over the unique event times $j$ in stratum $z$, therefore written here simply as indices $j(z)$. 
The proportions of patients at risk at time $t_{j}$, per arm $k = 0, 1$ in stratum $z$ are denoted by $\overline{Y}_{zk}(t_{j})$. Importantly, the proportion is with regards to the total number of patients across all strata, not just within stratum $z$.

So we can see that the score function is a sum over strata $z$ of the standard log-rank score function.
In the same way, the variance estimator $\sigma_{SL}^{2}(\theta)$ is the sum over strata $z$ of the standard log-rank variance estimator $\sigma_{L}^{2}(\theta)$.

The standard error of the correspondingly estimated log hazard ratio $\hat{\theta}_{SL}$ is given by

$$
\frac{1}{\sqrt{n} \sigma_{SL}(\hat{\theta}_{SL})}.
$$

One small important detail is that the number of patients $n$ in the denominator is always the total number of patients across all strata, not the number of patients in stratum $z$. This is the reason why the standard log-rank score function `RobinCar2:::h_lr_score_no_strata_no_cov()` has an argument `n`, which is used here by the stratified log-rank score function `RobinCar2:::h_lr_score_strat()` to pass on the total number of patients.

## Covariate adjusted analysis without strata

A little bit more complex is the calculation of the score function for the covariate adjusted log-rank test, which following Section 3 in @YeShaoYi2023 is given by:

$$
U_{CL}(\theta) =
U_{L}(\theta) - \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} 
\{
I_{i}(X_{i} - \overline{X})^{\top} \hat{\beta}_{1}(\theta_{L}) - 
(1 - I_{i})(X_{i} - \overline{X})^{\top} \hat{\beta}_{0}(\theta_{L}) 
\}.
$$

Here we have to explain a lot of notation. The score function $U_{CL}(\theta)$ is based on the standard log-rank score function $U_{L}(\theta)$, but we subtract a correction term that accounts for the covariates $X_{i}$ of patient $i$. The covariates are assumed to be centered, i.e. $\overline{X} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} X_{i}$ is the mean of the covariates across all patients.

Interestingly on the right hand side we see also $\theta_{L}$. This is supposed to be the log hazard ratio estimated by the standard log-rank analysis, i.e. $\hat{\theta}_{L}$, when finding the root of $U_{CL}(\theta)$ to estimate the log hazard ratio $\hat{\theta}_{CL}$. The reason for this is that the asymptotic guaranteed efficiency gain of the covariate adjusted log hazard ratio estimator is only proven using this version of the score function, see Section 3 in @YeShaoYi2023. On the other hand, for calculating the covariate adjusted log-rank score test statistic, we set both $\theta = 0$ and $\theta_{L} = 0$.

How are the regression coefficients $\hat{\beta}_{1}$ and $\hat{\beta}_{0}$ in the correction term estimated given a log hazard ratio $\theta$? 

First, the so-called derived outcomes $O_{ik}$ for patients $i$ and arms $k=0,1$ need to be calculated. Let $Y_{ik}(t)$ be the indicator whether patient $i$ in treatment arm $k = 0,1$ is at risk at time $t$, and let $\delta_{i}$ be the binary event indicator for patient $i$. Then the derived outcomes are defined as:

$$
\begin{align*}
O_{ik}(\theta) 
&= \int_{0}^{\tau} 
\frac{
  \{\exp(\theta) \overline{Y}_{1}(t)\}^{(1-k)}
  \{\overline{Y}_{0}(t)\}^{k}
}{\overline{Y}_{\theta}(t)} 
\left\{ 
  dN_{ik}(t) - 
\frac{Y_{ik}(t) \exp(\theta) d\overline{N}(t)}
{\overline{Y}_{\theta}(t)} 
\right\}
\\
&= 
\sum_{j=1}^{m}
\frac{
  \{\exp(\theta) \overline{Y}_{1}(t_{j})\}^{(1-k)}
  \{\overline{Y}_{0}(t_{j})\}^{k}
}{\overline{Y}_{\theta}(t_{j})} 
\left\{ 
  \delta_{i} \mathbb{I}(t_{j} = t_{i}) - 
\frac{Y_{ik}(t_{j}) \exp(\theta) m(t_{j}) / n}
{\overline{Y}_{\theta}(t_{j})} 
\right\}
\end{align*}
$$

where we can see that the count measure integral was again replaced by a sum over the unique event times $t_{j}, j = 1, \dotsc, m$.

Second, given the derived outcomes $O_{ik}(\theta)$, the coefficients estimate $\hat{\beta}_{k}(\theta)$ for treatment arm $k = 0, 1$ is defined as the solution to the least squares problem with the centered covariates $X_{i} - \overline{X}_{k}$ (therefore no constant intercept column in $X_{i}$) and responses $O_{ik}(\theta)$.

Finally, we can define the variance estimator as follows:

$$
\sigma_{CL}^{2}(\theta) =
\sigma_{L}^{2}(\theta) - 
  \hat{\pi}(1 - \hat{\pi}) 
  (\hat{\beta}_{0}(\theta_{L}) + \hat{\beta}_{1}(\theta_{L}))^{\top}
  \hat{\Sigma}_{X}
  (\hat{\beta}_{0}(\theta_{L}) + \hat{\beta}_{1}(\theta_{L}))
$$

where $\hat{\pi} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} I_{i}$ is the proportion of patients in treatment arm 1, and $\hat{\Sigma}_{X}$ is the sample covariance matrix of the centered covariates $X_{i} - \overline{X}$ (where the average is now taken across all patients, not just within treatment arm $k$).

Similarly as the for the score function defined above, the right hand side of the variance estimator is evaluated at $\theta = 0$ and $\theta_{L} = 0$ when calculating the covariate adjusted log-rank test statistic. 

However, when estimating the covariate adjusted log hazard ratio $\hat{\theta}_{CL}$, the regression coefficients $\hat{\beta}_{0}(\hat{\theta}_{L})$ and $\hat{\beta}_{1}(\hat{\theta}_{L})$ are fixed at the unadjusted log hazard ratio $\hat{\theta}_{L}$ in this expression for the standard error of $\hat{\theta}_{CL}$:

$$
\frac{\sqrt{
  \sigma_{L}^{2}(\hat{\theta}_{CL}) - 
  \hat{\pi}(1 - \hat{\pi}) 
  (\hat{\beta}_{0}(\hat{\theta}_{L}) + \hat{\beta}_{1}(\hat{\theta}_{L}))^{\top}
  \hat{\Sigma}_{X}
  (\hat{\beta}_{0}(\hat{\theta}_{L}) + \hat{\beta}_{1}(\hat{\theta}_{L}))
}}{
  \sqrt{n} \sigma_{L}^{2}(\hat{\theta}_{CL}) 
}
$$

This is the published version of the variance estimator when used for estimating the standard error of $\hat{\theta}_{CL}$ via $\sigma_{L}^{2}(\hat{\theta}_{CL})$, which is the default in `RobinCar2`. However, there is also an alternative version which we call "unadjusted" where $\sigma_{L}^{2}(\hat{\theta}_{CL})$ on the right hand side of the definition is replaced by $\sigma_{L}^{2}(\hat{\theta}_{L})$. That is, the log-rank score variance estimator is evaluated at the unadjusted log hazard ratio estimate $\hat{\theta}_{L}$, rather than at the covariate adjusted log hazard ratio estimate $\hat{\theta}_{CL}$. This version is available via the option `se_method = "unadjusted"`, and is the version implemented in the `RobinCar` package. 

Note that the results will differ only very slightly. Both resulting standard errors are consistent and valid. One motivation for the unadjusted version is that it is guaranteed to be smaller than the standard error of the unadjusted log hazard ratio, due to the fact that the correction term is always positive.

This score function and the variance estimator are implemented in the internal function `RobinCar2:::h_lr_score_cov()`.

## Covariate adjusted and stratified analysis

Finally, using both covariate adjustment and stratification, following Section S2.3 in @YeShaoYi2023, the score function is given by:

$$
U_{CSL}(\theta) =
U_{SL}(\theta) - \frac{1}{n} \sum_{z} \sum_{i: Z_{i} = z}
\{
I_{i}(X_{i} - \overline{X}_{z})^{\top} \hat{\beta}_{1}(\theta_{SL}) - 
(1 - I_{i})(X_{i} - \overline{X}_{z})^{\top} \hat{\beta}_{0}(\theta_{SL}) 
\},
$$

which shows us that it is based on the score function $U_{SL}(\theta)$ from the stratified but not covariate-adjusted log-rank test. The correction term is added up over the strata $z$, but based on overall regression coefficients $\hat{\beta}_{0}(\theta_{SL})$ and $\hat{\beta}_{1}(\theta_{SL})$.

Similarly as for the unstratified covariate adjusted log-rank test, the derived outcomes $O_{zik}(\theta)$ in stratum $z$ are defined as:

$$
\begin{align*}
O_{zik}(\theta) 
&= \int_{0}^{\tau} 
\frac{
  \{\exp(\theta) \overline{Y}_{z1}(t)\}^{(1-k)}
  \{\overline{Y}_{z0}(t)\}^{k}
}{\overline{Y}_{z\theta}(t)} 
\left\{ 
  dN_{ik}(t) - 
\frac{Y_{ik}(t) \exp(\theta) d\overline{N}_{z}(t)}
{\overline{Y}_{z\theta}(t)} 
\right\}
\\
&= 
\sum_{j(z)}
\frac{
  \{\exp(\theta) \overline{Y}_{z1}(t_{j})\}^{(1-k)}
  \{\overline{Y}_{z0}(t_{j})\}^{k}
}{\overline{Y}_{z\theta}(t_{j})} 
\left\{ 
  \delta_{i} \mathbb{I}(t_{j} = t_{i}) - 
\frac{Y_{ik}(t_{j}) \exp(\theta) m_{z}(t_{j}) / n}
{\overline{Y}_{z\theta}(t_{j})} 
\right\}
\end{align*}
$$

where $m_{z}(t_{j}) = \sum_{i: Z_{i} = z} \delta_{i} \mathbb{I}(t_{j} = t_{i})$ is the number of events in stratum $z$ at the unique event time $t_{j}$, and we further abbreviated

$$
Y_{z\theta}(t) = \overline{Y}_{z0}(t) + \exp(\theta) \overline{Y}_{z1}(t).
$$

Now as a second step, given the derived outcomes $O_{zik}(\theta)$, the coefficients estimate $\hat{\beta}_{k}(\theta)$ for treatment arm $k = 0, 1$ is defined as:

$$
\hat{\beta}_{k}(\theta) = 
\left\{
  \sum_{z} \sum_{i: I_{i} = k, Z_{i} = z}
  (X_{i} - \overline{X}_{zk})
  (X_{i} - \overline{X}_{zk})^{\top}
\right\}^{-1}
\sum_{z} \sum_{i: I_{i} = k, Z_{i} = z}
  (X_{i} - \overline{X}_{zk})
  O_{zik}(\theta).
$$

So we see that within each treatment group and within each stratum, the covariates are centered separately, and the required cross-products are added from all strata. 
Finally the coefficient estimates are obtained by solving the least squares problem with the derived outcomes $O_{zik}(\theta)$ as responses.

Finally, the variance estimator is defined very similarly to the covariate adjusted but unstratified log-rank test:

$$
\sigma_{CSL}^{2}(\theta) =
\sigma_{SL}^{2}(\theta) - 
  \hat{\pi}(1 - \hat{\pi}) 
  (\hat{\beta}_{0}(\theta_{SL}) + \hat{\beta}_{1}(\theta_{SL}))^{\top}
  \left\{\sum_{z} n_z / n \hat{\Sigma}_{X\vert z}\right\}
  (\hat{\beta}_{0}(\theta_{SL}) + \hat{\beta}_{1}(\theta_{SL}))
$$ 

where $n_z$ is the number of patients in stratum $z$ and $\hat{\Sigma}_{X\vert z}$ is the sample covariance matrix of the original covariates $X_{i}$ within stratum $z$.

In the same way as for the unstratified case, when estimating the covariate adjusted stratified log hazard ratio $\hat{\theta}_{CSL}$, the regression coefficients $\hat{\beta}_{0}(\hat{\theta}_{SL})$ and $\hat{\beta}_{1}(\hat{\theta}_{SL})$ are fixed at the unadjusted log hazard ratio $\hat{\theta}_{SL}$ in this expression for the standard error of $\hat{\theta}_{CSL}$:

$$
\frac{\sqrt{
  \sigma_{SL}^{2}(\hat{\theta}_{CSL}) - 
  \hat{\pi}(1 - \hat{\pi}) 
  (\hat{\beta}_{0}(\hat{\theta}_{SL}) + \hat{\beta}_{1}(\hat{\theta}_{SL}))^{\top}
  \{\sum_{z} n_z / n \hat{\Sigma}_{X\vert z}\}
  (\hat{\beta}_{0}(\hat{\theta}_{SL}) + \hat{\beta}_{1}(\hat{\theta}_{SL}))
}}{
  \sqrt{n} \sigma_{SL}^{2}(\hat{\theta}_{CSL}) 
}
$$

This is the published version of the variance estimator when used for estimating the standard error of $\hat{\theta}_{CSL}$ via $\sigma_{SL}^{2}(\hat{\theta}_{CSL})$, which is the default in `RobinCar2`. However, there is also an alternative version which we call "unadjusted" where $\sigma_{SL}^{2}(\hat{\theta}_{CSL})$ on the right hand side of the definition is replaced by $\sigma_{SL}^{2}(\hat{\theta}_{SL})$. That is, the log-rank score variance estimator is evaluated at the unadjusted log hazard ratio estimate $\hat{\theta}_{SL}$, rather than at the covariate adjusted log hazard ratio estimate $\hat{\theta}_{CSL}$. This version is available via the option `se_method = "unadjusted"`, and is the version implemented in the `RobinCar` package. 

Note that the results will differ only very slightly. Both resulting standard errors are consistent and valid. One motivation for the unadjusted version is that it is guaranteed to be smaller than the standard error of the unadjusted log hazard ratio, due to the fact that the correction term is always positive.

This score function and the variance estimator are implemented in the internal function `RobinCar2:::h_lr_score_strat_cov()`.
