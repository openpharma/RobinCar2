\usage{
robin_surv(
  formula,
  data,
  treatment,
  comparisons,
  contrast = "hazardratio",
  test = "logrank",
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{formula}{(\code{formula}) A formula of analysis, of the form
\code{Surv(time, status) ~ covariates}. (If no covariates should be adjusted for, use \code{1} instead
on the right hand side.)}

\item{data}{(\code{data.frame}) Input data frame.}

\item{treatment}{(\code{formula}) A formula of treatment assignment or assignment by stratification.}

\item{comparisons}{(\code{list}) An optional list of comparisons between treatment levels to be performed,
see details. By default, all pairwise comparisons are performed automatically.}

\item{contrast}{(\code{character(1)}) The contrast statistic to be used, currently only \code{"hazardratio"}
is supported.}

\item{test}{(\code{character(1)}) The test to be used, currently only \code{"logrank"} is supported.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments passed to the survival analysis functions, in particular \code{hr_se_plugin_adjusted}
(please see \link[=survival_score_functions]{here} for details).}
}
\value{
A \code{surv_effect} object containing the results of the survival analysis.
}
\description{
Calculate log-rank test as well as hazard ratio estimates for survival data, optionally adjusted
for covariates and a stratification factor.
}
\details{
The user can optionally specify a list of comparisons between treatment levels to be performed.
The list must have two elements:
\itemize{
\item Treatment level indices of the treatment group.
\item Treatment level indices of the control group.
}

So for example if you would like to compare level 3 with level 1, and also level 3 with level 2
(but not level 2 with level 1) then you can specify:
\code{comparisons = list(c(3, 3), c(1, 2))}
}
\examples{
# Adjusted for covariates meal.cal and age and adjusted for stratification by sex:
robin_surv(
  formula = Surv(time, status) ~ meal.cal + age,
  data = surv_data,
  treatment = sex ~ strata
)

# Unadjusted for covariates and stratification:
robin_surv(
  formula = Surv(time, status) ~ 1,
  data = surv_data,
  treatment = sex ~ 1
)
}
